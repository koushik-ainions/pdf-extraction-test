A leave policy is a set of guidelines and procedures that govern the usage of various types of leaves available to employees within an organization. This policy aims to ensure fair treatment, consistent application of rules, and compliance with legal requirements.

If anybody takes 2 days off from work, for instance it is Saturday and Monday as annual leaves, then here instead of deducting 2 leaves from annual leave balance, it will be deducted 3 leaves, as the Sunday has been sandwiched, so it will come under the sandwich rule. During Probation, there is no leave.

12 days annually will be work from home, that means 2 days in a month. After any holidays or week off work from home is not allowed. For PL, at least before a week leave dates should be uploaded in HRM Portal as well as mail to Reporting lead and HR Team.
