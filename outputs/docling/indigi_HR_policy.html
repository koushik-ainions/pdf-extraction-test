During Probation, there is no leave.</p>
<p>12 days annually will be work from home, that means 2 days in a month. After any holidays or week off work from home is not allow. For PL, at least before a week leave dates should be uploaded in HRM Portal as well as mail to Reporting lead and HR Team.</p>
