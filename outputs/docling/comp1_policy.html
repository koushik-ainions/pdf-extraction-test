<p>Improvement of information security culture - declares the need not only to inform all employees of  the  Company,  its  Business  Partners  and  third  parties  using  the  Company's  IT  assets  about information security requirements, but also to develop skills of acceptable information handling and secure work with the Company's IT assets.</p>
<p>Development of competencies and professionalism -  the  principle  means  the  need  to  constantly develop the competencies and practical skills of information security specialists under conditions of continuous  change  of  IS  risks,  landscape  of  used  information  technologies  and  techniques  of</p>
<p>1   These  principles  have  been  developed  taking  into  account  international  standards  and  practices  in  the  field  of  information  security, including  COBIT 5 for Information Security; ITIL: 2011 Service Design; ISO/IEC TS 19249:2017.</p>
<p>potential violators. Ensuring information security in the automation of technological and production processes requires competence and knowledge in the areas of industrial automation and metrology.</p>

<p>Information security as an integral property of an IT asset is a principle that is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> Information security requirements shall be taken into account at all stages of the IT asset life cycle, regardless of the level of confidentiality of the information processed in the IT asset;</li>
<li> development of software products in the Company's interests is carried out using methods of secure software development;</li>

<li> compliance of the acquired/implemented IT asset with the required information security level is confirmed in accordance with the existing procedures, taking into account the requirements of the applicable legislation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information security as an integral property of IT services -  means that  IT-services offered and provided to the Company or in the interests of the Company must be designed and implemented in accordance with information security requirements.</p>
<p>Compatibility - refers to the selection of components for information security in a way that ensures their  mutual  system  compatibility  at  the  information,  software,  electromagnetic  and  operational levels,  as  well  as  compatibility  with  the  used  IT  solutions,  information  technologies  and  with solutions for automating the Company's technological and production processes.</p>

<p>Segregation and minimization of duties - means that critical (final) operations are performed only by means of segregation of actions (for example, algorithmic  segregation, temporary or resource segregation  -  including  by  two  employees).  The  elimination  of  a  sole  critical  operation  can  be organized  at  the  level  of  organizational  measures  and/or  software  and  hardware  by  delegating authorities or user role. The software and hardware method of segregation of  duties is preferable over  organizational.  There  should  be  a  control  of  realization  of  principles  of  critical  authorities differentiation in information systems and in ACS, restriction of access rights, depending on a level</p>
<p>of  the  agreed  authorities.  The  authorities  should  be  minimally  sufficient  to  enable  the  person  to perform  his  or  her  official  duties  or  fulfil  contractual  obligations.
