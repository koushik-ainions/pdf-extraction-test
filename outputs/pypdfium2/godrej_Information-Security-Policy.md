manner that data should be beyond retrieval. 
• Non-disclosure agreement shall be signed between the Organization and external contractor for 
outsourcing disposal. Certificates of secure disposal shall be obtained from external contractor.
21. Data Security Policy 
• GILAC shall implement mechanisms to prevent the accidental disclosure of email and attachments 
to unauthorized individuals by enforcing encryption between email servers (e.g. using Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) or equivalent).
• Email servers shall protect messages by using digital signatures to identify if email messages 
have been modified in transit.
• Users shall be educated in how to protect the confidentiality and integrity of email messages 
(e.g. by the use of encryption, digital certificates and digital signatures).
• Data Security solution (e.g. DLP, IRM, etc.) should be used to identify specific types of sensitive 
information, monitor channels of data leakage (vectors) and take actions to prevent this data 
from leaking.
• Data Security solution should be configured to monitor and control the flow of sensitive data 
using technical Data Security solution policies, defining: 
1. what data can and cannot be sent, posted, uploaded, moved or copied and 
pasted.
2. where data can be transmitted.
3. who can send and receive data (e.g. via email).
4. how data can be shared.
• Data Security solution should be configured to include a register of keywords, electronic 
document characteristics and the specific types of sensitive information (sometimes referred to 
as pre-registration) that need to be protected from unauthorized disclosure.
• Data Security solution should be configured to detect sensitive data by using 
1. described content matching, which checks data against regular expressions, 
defined strings, keywords, patterns or dictionaries (a list of specific terms, 
keywords or key phrases); 
2. fingerprinting (indexing), which takes a cryptographic hash of a sample file or 
file contents to create a 'fingerprint', checking content against this 
fingerprint for complete or partial matches (i.e. to detect either the complete 
text or excerpts that match the sample document)
3. machine learning, which uses algorithms and statistical techniques to 
determine if content is similar to test data, used to train the machine 
learning algorithm, used by the Data Security solution
4. optional character recognition (image recognition), which analyses image 
files (e.g. screenshots or scanned documents) and extracts text to find 
matches for sensitive content.

Godrej Information Security Policy
Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies Page 30 of 41
• Data Security solution should be configured to monitor data leakage channels where sensitive 
data is in motion (e.g. data traversing a network such as the internet or private network), in use 
(e.g. data processed on endpoint devices) or at rest (e.g. data stored in file systems, databases, 
the cloud or endpoint devices)
• Backups should be encrypted to protect sensitive information, when:
1. transmitted via a network to external storage facilities, particularly when 
engaging with a third party to support backup capabilities
2. stored on physical media, to prevent unauthorized access in the event 
backups are lost or stolen in transit to an alternative location, such as an off￾site storage facility
• Data processed by cloud services should be protected, which includes encrypting sensitive data 
by using the CSP default encryption solution, configuring customer-managed key encryption or 
implementing customer-supplied key encryption.
• USB shall be blocked for all end-users. In case of any deviation, policy change shall be pre￾approved by the respective Business heads. 
• Sensitive information shall not be kept for longer than it is required to reduce the risk of 
undesirable disclosure.
• Information shall be deleted from systems, applications, and services in accordance with 
business requirements and taking into consideration relevant laws and regulations.
• When using service suppliers for information deletion, evidence of information deletion shall be 
obtained from them.
22. Capacity Management Policy 
• Systems capacity shall be monitored. Capacity monitoring data shall be analyzed to identify the 
trends and discrepancies on a regular basis, especially for critical systems.
• New business and system requirements, as well as the current and future trends for information 
systems usage shall be used to develop future projections for capacity requirements.
• GILAC shall identify the required actionable for capacity management to ensure effective 
performance of information systems and business processes. The action plan shall identify and 
consider the capacity requirements based on business criticality of the concerned systems, 
business requirements, Service Level Agreements, Memorandums of Understanding, and risk 
assessments.
23. System Acquisition, Development, Planning and Maintenance Policy 
• GILAC shall ensure that cybersecurity requirements are included in the entire lifecycle of 
information systems & applications, whether acquired or developed, and integrated as early as 
possible.
• Security engineering principles should be established, documented and applied to information 
system engineering activities. Security should be designed into all architecture layers.
